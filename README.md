# Algerian Statical Solar Radiation DataBase 
this is the main repository of the webapp that containe the radiation data for 58 provinces in Algeria on horizontal and inclined surface , the short Name of this webapp is ASSR-DB
## how data was calculated 
the database of the radiation was calculated using Source from Nasa Website " this sources are the dailly  radiations meusurement" with the statical approche 
the database consiste of to have many information that we will add to it incrementaly 
### 1) the Horizontal radiation 
the horizontal radiation is the flow of sunshine on a horizental surface on earth as precedent explication this is the brut data from the statical calculation using the nasa data 
### 2)  the inclined radiation 
this data is for the radiation on a surfaces in a  specifique angle where we can collect the maximum of radiation physicaly this mean that the surface is in 0Â° with the sun but the data publushed is the mid value because in the feild of the renewable energy all the time we have fixed pannel on the roof
